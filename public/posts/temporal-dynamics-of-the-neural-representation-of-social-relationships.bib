	abstract = {Humans can rapidly encode information from faces to support social judgments and facilitate interactions with others. We can also recall complex knowledge about those individuals, such as their social relationships with others, but the time course of this process has not been examined in detail. This study addressed the temporal dynamics of emerging visual and social relationship information using EEG and representational similarity analysis. Participants (female = 23, male = 10) became familiar with a 10-person social network, and were then shown faces of that network{\textquoteright}s members while EEG was recorded. To examine the temporal dynamics of the cognitive processes related to face perception, we compared the similarity structure of neural pattern responses to models of visual processing, face shape similarity, person identity, and social relationships. We found that all types of information are associated with neural patterns after a face is seen. Visual models became significant early after image onset, and identity across a change in facial expression was uniquely associated with neural patterns at several points throughout the time course. Additionally, a model reflecting perceived frequency of social interaction was present beginning at \~{}110 ms, even in the absence of an explicit task to think about the relationships among the network members. This study highlights the speed and salience of social information relating to group dynamics that are present in the brain during person perception.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We live our lives in social groups where complex relationships form among and around us. It is likely that some of the information about social relationships that we observe is integral during person perception, to better help us interact in differing situations with a variety of people. However, when exactly this information becomes relevant has been unclear. In this study, we present evidence that information reflecting observed relationships among a social network is spontaneously represented in whole-brain patterns shortly following presentation of a face. These results are consistent with neuroimaging studies showing spontaneous spatial representation of social network characteristics, and contribute novel insights into the timing of these neural processes.},
