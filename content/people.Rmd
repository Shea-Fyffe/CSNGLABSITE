## Graduate Research Assistants

#### Lindsay S Schaffer
![](/./people_files/LSHS.jpg)

Ms. Lindsay Shaffer is a third year doctoral student in the Department of Psychology's Cognitive & Behavioral Neuroscience program at George Mason University. Lindsay's PhD advisor is Dr. James Thompson and is a member of the Computational Social Neuroscience Group (CSNG). She is a Fellow of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions (CASBBI).

Currenty, Lindsay's research focuses on how sensory and value information independently contributes to reward representations and how reward representations are impaired in idiopathic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Lindsay's research incorporates behavioral paradigms, computational modeling, and imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, EEG). As a part of the CASBBI NRT, Lindsay is collaborating with members from the S.T.A.R. Lab and the Biomedical Imaging Lab to develop techniques to remotely measure movement and non-movement symptoms in Parkinson's disease."

#### Eslam Hassan

![](/./people_files/EHHS.jpg) 

Ms. Hassan's previous work involved investigating the underlying neural circuits in reward processing, specifically in social reward. Current research involves evaluating the levels of social isolation and loneliness in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and deciphering if they are possible aversive states for negative behavior. Her general research interests are focused in learning and memory in students, specifically the differences between memory retrieval and retention, and the relationships between emotion and reasoning and how genetic differences hold an influence in decision-making. She also has a love of biological sciences beyond psychology, specifically human anatomy and physiology.
